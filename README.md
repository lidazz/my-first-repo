### Geography

I grew up in the city center of Athens, Greece. I moved to Geneva and Barcelona for work and studies and now I am back to where it all started.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Rayuela* by Julio Cortázar
- *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara
- *Llamadas telefónicas* by Roberto Bolaño

### Food

Things I am likely to order when eating out:

1. Laxanontolmades
2. Seafood
3. Souvlaki

### Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is [on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lidazacharopoulou/) or my **actual**  [github page](https://github.com/leedah).
